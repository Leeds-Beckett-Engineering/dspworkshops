    "# Workshop 4: Fast Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop looks at how we can use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to look at some different types of signal in the frequency domain. The introduction of the FFT algorithm by J. W. Cooley and J. W. Tukey in 1965 revolutionised approaches to signal processing. The FFT enables faster processing of real-time data, and is utilised in many everyday digital devices. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, SciPy has a module [`fft`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/fft.html) which has functions for many different discrete transforms. Indeed there is a SciPy [FFT tutorial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/fft.html) which looks at the theory of the transforms as well as discussing how they can be used."
